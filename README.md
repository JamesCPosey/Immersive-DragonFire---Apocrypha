# Immersive DragonFire - Apocrypha 

## Description

A revamp of the rewards that Dragonborn Force/Flame/Frost grant players, inspired by the dragon shout replacers of Old 

## Features

Shout replacement: Choosing one of Dragonborn Force, Flame or Frost will check for the fully unlocked version of the associated shout and grant you a new version. Flame and Frost now come with the breath of an actual Dovah, and all three will grant you a temporary Ancient Dragonborn armor.
Balance: Working within the original intention of the Black Book Rewards, I have also implemented the rewards as such that you can only have one of the empowered shouts at a time. I think it matters more for the player if there is a choice and this allows me to target specific tweaks for each shout based on separate playstyles that focus on different strengths.
Livening up vanilla/DLC: I alwways felt like there should have been some way in the vanilla game to acquire the dragon versions of fire and frost breath. One of the first mods I ever downloaded was DragonFire for that exact reason. I set out to make something both in SE/AE
NO DRAUGR: One side effect of previous implementations of DragonFire is that it would also give Draugr the dragon versions of the shout. Using this method avoids it unless specifically implemented

## Installation

 **Requirements**
 
   - None other than the original game + Dragonborn. Future versions may require SKSE 

 **Manual Installation**
 
   - Download .7z file to any folder you keep loose mods in.
   - Extract files directly into the Skyrim Special Edition\Data folder 

 **Mod Manager Installation**
 
   - Use "Install with Mod Manager" button to install with preferred Mod Manager. 

## Uninstallation

  - Not entirely tested. While nothing jumps out from top of mind, this mod does use scripts with properties that may persist as well as the fact that once you've claimed a boon you'll be missing a vanilla shout in your shouts menu. Re-adding is safe, but I'll have better notes later.

## Compatibility

- Partially compatible with shout mods. My shouts use duplicated+modified spells so they may not be tagged for improvements or extra effects. Anything that modifies the Force/Flame/Frost effects will need a patch at the very least
- Previous versions may encounter an issue where using a True Dovah shout will unequip the Ancient Dragonborn armor if used while under Dragon Aspect. Workaround should be available in 1.5 and above

## Usage

- Reach Solstheim and get your hands on Epistolary Acumen. Then complete the dungeon and listen to Mora's speech. 

## Additional Notes

- Future plans include adding a chance that high level Draugr will use a "True Dovah" shout, and giving Miraak one based on player gameplay.
